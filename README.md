# Robot Framework Web Testing Installation Guide

Welcome to the installation guide for setting up the Robot Framework for web testing. Robot Framework is an open-source automation framework for acceptance testing, acceptance test-driven development (ATDD), and robotic process automation (RPA). It can be extended with libraries to test web applications among other applications.

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding with the installation of the Robot Framework, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

- **Python**: Robot Framework requires Python, and it supports Python 3.6 or newer. You can download Python from [the official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Make sure to add Python to your system's PATH.
- **pip**: Ensure pip, Python's package installer, is installed. It typically comes with Python installations.

## Installation Steps

Follow these steps to install Robot Framework and the necessary libraries for web testing:

### Step 1: Install Robot Framework

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Install Robot Framework by running the following command:

   ```
   pip install robotframework
   ```

### Step 2: Install SeleniumLibrary

Robot Framework's web testing capabilities are provided by SeleniumLibrary. To install it, execute:

```
pip install --upgrade robotframework-seleniumlibrary
```

### Step 3: Install WebDriver

To perform tests on different web browsers, you need to install WebDriver for each browser you plan to use:

- **Chrome**: Download [ChromeDriver](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/) and ensure it's in your PATH.
- **Firefox**: Download [GeckoDriver](https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases) and ensure it's in the PATH.
- **Edge**: Download [EdgeDriver](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/tools/webdriver/) and ensure it's in the PATH.

**Note**: Other browsers have their own drivers.

### Step 4: Verify Installation

Verify the installation by running:

```
robot --version
```

You should see the version of Robot Framework printed in the terminal.

## Run The Test

To confirm everything is set up correctly, let's run the test case:

3. Run the test by executing:

   ```
   robot Tests
   ```

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You have successfully set up Robot Framework for web testing. You're now ready to write more comprehensive test cases and explore the extensive capabilities of Robot Framework and SeleniumLibrary.

## Additional Resources
